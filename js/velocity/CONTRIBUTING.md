**Bug Reporting**

- Make sure you're using the latest version of Velocity.

- Unless you're reporting an obvious bug that can be immediately recreated by anyone, please **create a demo** with the minimum amount of code needed to reproduce your bug. You can use this template, which already has Velocity and its UI pack loaded: http://jsfiddle.net/hN9AT/.

- Please read the FAQ before asking questions: https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/issues/47.
